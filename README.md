# iris-classifier
A python code to classifiy different flowers on basis of their attributes

This is an example of a Datmo Model which uses iris dataset to classify between different flower types.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

-Id
-SepalLengthCm
-SepalWidthCm
-PetalLengthCm
-PetalWidthCm
-Species
